### SEO
- For this project I implemented a strong SEO strategy for my Blade Custom Folding Knife web-shop in my Django project. First, I conducted thorough keyword research to identify the most relevant long and short-tail keywords for my products. I optimized my title tags, meta descriptions, and URLs, ensuring they included these keywords to improve my web-shop's visibility in search engine results. I also focused on creating high-quality content that naturally incorporated the identified keywords. For images, I used descriptive file names and alt tags to enhance their optimization. to improve the visibility of my web-shop in search engine rankings and attract potential customers searching for related products., I strategically used internal and external linking techniques

- Procfile: This file defines the commands executed during deployment of your Django app on a hosting platform.
- Templates: The project includes a base-level folder containing fundamental templates that are extended throughout other templates such as base.html, navigation, toast messages files and footer.html. It also includes templates for user authentication. Additionally, each app within the project has its own templates folder with HTML files that support the specific functionality and promote reusability within the app.
- Static: The project includes a "static" directory that contains the base CSS and JavaScript files. This directory serves as a central location for storing and organizing the static assets used throughout the project. In addition to the base-level files, each app within the project may have its own static directory to house CSS and JavaScript files specific to that app's functionality.

## Agile Design

### Overview

- For this project Agile principles and design was implemented from a start since this was the 2nd time in my development career that im implementing agile. While process was familiar, plan was set from beginning and it was adjusted along the way. Drawing from my previous experience, I knew that Agile would empower me to embrace change and prioritize tasks efficiently, ensuring that I consistently delivered incremental value to my project.I leveraged techniques such as user stories,kanban boards an milestones to maintain a clear project vision.This time kanban board are constructed by iterations(sprints)This iterative development cycle gave mae a regular chance to review and try to refine my work.Overall, learning and implementing Agile as a solo developer working on my e-commerce project has been a highly rewarding experience.By implementing Agile principles and design, I was confident in delivering a high-quality and user-focused e-commerce solution.


### Epics(Milestones)
- By effectively leveraging GitHub's 'Milestones' feature and thoughtfully connecting user stories to their corresponding tasks, I created a well-defined set of 4 epics for this project.

<details><summary>See epics</summary>
<img src="docs/agile/epics.png">
</details>

### User stories

- I started by creating a user story template using GitHub issues. As the project progressed, these initial rough sketches evolved and were refined into complete user stories.

### Moscow prioritization
    - This prioritization technique was used to to efficiently sort and handle project requirements based on their  significance and immediate importance.
    While my implementation may not have been flawless, it proved valuable in ensuring that the most critical requirements received prompt attention and were addressed as a priority

### Iterations(Sprints)

- As a solo developer in my project, sprints  provided structured and manageable periods of work. I was able to plan and execute tasks within these iterations, ensuring focused progress. At the end of each sprint, I tried tov review the completed work and adapt my plan based on feedback and changing priorities.

#### 1st sprint


- In my first sprint, I focused on the initial epic of setting up the development environment and adding a basic skeleton structure to the home and shop templates. This allowed me to establish a solid foundation for the project and lay the groundwork for future development tasks.

#### 3nd sprint


- In the third sprint, my main objective was to finalize the Payment epic, ensuring a smooth and secure payment process for users. I dedicated my efforts to testing  the payment functionality by following Stripe documentation and implementing webhooks functionality to guarantee its reliability.

Additionally, I began working on the last epic, which included implementing various other features such as customer reviews, wishlist functionality, contact forms, and user profiles. By starting and finalizing these features, I aimed to enhance user engagement, enable personalized experiences, and provide a seamless way for users to connect with the platform.

- Closing words on Agile


Using Agile methodologies in the three sprints of my solo e-commerce project, I made steady progress by breaking tasks into smaller parts. This approach allowed me to prioritize and deliver important features step by step. With continuous feedback and adjustments, I improved the development environment, implemented crucial functionalities, and built a user-friendly e-commerce platform. Agile proved to be a valuable framework, helping me navigate complexities, achieve tangible results, and prioritize user satisfaction.
